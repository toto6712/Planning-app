The previous AI engineer effectively initiated the development of a travel time caching mechanism for a route optimization application. The core challenge involved efficiently calculating and storing travel times between intervention locations to avoid repetitive and costly API calls. The engineer adapted to significant shifts in user requirements, moving from an initial idea of dynamic OpenStreetMap API integration to a more controlled, user-provided geocoding approach, and then to an automated, but locally optimized, OSRM-based calculation. The work involved creating new services for caching and OSRM interaction, modifying existing data models and parsers to accommodate latitude/longitude inputs, and debugging various CSV parsing issues (encoding, decimal separators). The current state sees the system performing large-scale OSRM calculations, which led to a timeout issue, prompting the user to request a local OSRM installation for performance. The engineer is currently in the process of setting up OSRM locally.

The user initially aimed to optimize travel time calculations for an intervention planning application. The problem was the inefficiency and cost of repeatedly querying the OpenStreetMap API for travel durations between locations for each upload. The proposed solution was to create a persistent CSV file caching all known travel durations, to be incremented with each upload, reducing API calls and processing time.

The requirements evolved:
1.  **Cache Mechanism**: Create a persistent CSV file (e.g., ) to store travel durations between locations.
2.  **Input Format Change**: Transition from address-based inputs in CSVs to Latitude and Longitude coordinates for both intervention and intervenant files.
3.  **Automated Calculation on Upload**: Upon CSV upload, a moulinette (process) should automatically calculate all travel times between the newly provided coordinates and all existing coordinates in the cache using a free API (specifically OpenStreetMap/OSRM), and then automatically store these in the cache.
4.  **Conditional AI Execution**: The system should verify if all necessary travel times are present in the cache before proceeding with the AI planning. If not, it should indicate missing data.
5.  **Fallback Mechanism**: If an OSRM calculation fails, a default travel time of 15 minutes should be assigned.
6.  **Performance Improvement**: Address timeout issues during large-scale OSRM calculations by installing OSRM locally within the Docker environment to ensure ultra-fast, internal processing.

<current_work>
The application has been significantly refactored to implement a robust travel time caching system. The backend, built with FastAPI, now accepts CSV uploads containing  and  coordinates for interventions and intervenants. Upon upload, a new  automatically orchestrates the calculation of travel times between all unique coordinate pairs using the OpenStreetMap Routing Machine (OSRM) API, storing these results in . This cache is designed to be persistent and incrementally enriched.

The system is currently functional for files using decimal points, with fixes implemented for French-specific CSV parsing issues (e.g., handling Durée column encoding and attempting to support comma-separated decimals). However, a major performance bottleneck was identified: large numbers of OSRM calculations (e.g., 1640 routes) from the external API were causing timeouts and prolonged processing times (estimated ~27 minutes initially, reduced to ~12-15 minutes with some optimizations).

The user explicitly requested to address this by installing OSRM locally. The AI engineer has initiated this process, identified the Linux distribution (Debian), confirmed available resources (8.3GB disk, 22GB RAM), and attempted to install OSRM. The last action was to install compilation dependencies after apt 2.6.1 (arm64)
